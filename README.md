### Why This Build System Helps Your Project?

- **This setup makes your workflow faster, cleaner, and more professional. Instead of manually rebuilding every time, everything is automated and reusable.**

---

### Easier Rebuilds

- **You donâ€™t need to manually open setup.py and rebuild the** `.pyx` **into** `.pyd` **or rename it into** `.dll` **.**
- **The ready-made build script does everything with one command.**
- **This saves time and effort, especially in large projects.**

---

### Fewer **Errors**

- **All those issues with** **`ModuleNotFound`**, **version mismatches, or wrong file names are avoided.**
- **The final version keeps everything consistent and properly linked.**

---

### Code Reusability

- **If you have another project or a new version of the same project, you can reuse the compiled** **`.pyd`** **and** **`.dll`** **files without rewriting or recompiling your source code**

---

### Easy Distribution

- **When sharing your project with others, you only need to provide the ready files** **(`.pyd`, `.dll`, `.py`).**
- **No need for the other person to install `Cython` or `Visual Studio` they can run it directly.**

---

### Faster Execution

- **Since the program skips build steps, it runs immediately. This is important for continuous testing or running large projects without rebuild overhead.**

---
### in Short
- T**his system makes your project more professional, portable, and future-proof, while saving you from common `Python`/`Cython` headaches.**
